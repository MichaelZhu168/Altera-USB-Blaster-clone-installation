Altera USB-Blaster (clone)
I have successfully used this one to upload and debug sipeed longan nano board.
---------------------

A few days ago, I got another JTAG debugger by converting a “sipeed longan nano” board (only $6.1 from mouser.com) into a RV-LINK debugger(it works as a standard JTAG debugger).
1.	Get it from mouser.com. It costs $6.1. but there is a $8 shipping charge. You can combine all other purchases together. The total shipping charge is still $8. I love mouser.com;
2.	Go to github search “RV-LINK”,  and get the hex file. (you can also build the hex file yourself). It is better to read the readme file;
3.	Using an existing programmer(or use a USB DFU software)  to write/upload the hex file to the “sipeed longan nano” board;
4.	Google “RV-LINK USB driver” or “covert sipeed longan nano to rv-link”, download and install it.
That is it. Now you have another debugger/programmer device.
